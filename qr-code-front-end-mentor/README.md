## Overview

Overall this was an easy project. I had to jog my memory on what I had learned in html and css, but I think that this was a good project to get my feet wet with front end mentor. 

## My process

I started with writing the html, by taking the pre-existing structure and assigning relevant classes to use later with flexbox in a container. Then, I used CSS to align everything the way I wanted with flexbox and added custom styles and fonts. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

There were a few things I think that I was able to strengthen during this exercise, mainly using padding shorthand to write more elegant code in CSS. I also solidified my understanding of flexbox, especially when creating new divs inside of a container div.

### Continued development

I feel much more confident with flexbox and other bvasic css properties, however, I would like to add some more advanced techniques to streamline my workflow.
